Google Analytics Customer Revenue Prediction

We are predicting the natural log of the sum of all transactions per user. Once the data is updated, as noted above, this will be for all users in test_v2.csv for December 1st, 2018 to January 31st, 2019. For every user in the test set, the target is:
yuser=âˆ‘i=1ntransactionuseri
targetuser=ln(yuser+1)
